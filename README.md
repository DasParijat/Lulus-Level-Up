# Marist Computer Society Hackathon Fall 2025 Submission
## By Sophia Masone, Parijat Das, and Joanna Picciano
This was a project submitted for the Hackathon on 11/9/2025.

# Idea: Lulu's Level up
## Theme: Productivity Tools
Lulu's level up is a task manager that rewards you with points that levels up Lulu (the dog). 
You gain points by completing the earliest task set, and each level requires more and more points 
to reach the next level.

One aspect of this program that makes it more unique beyond it's simple concept, is the fact that things
such as the button or text input box had to be made from the ground up, using the C++ media library SFML 2.6.0.

This project got in a three-way tie within second place at the Fall 2025 Hackathon.
